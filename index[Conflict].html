			<div id="aboutme" class="summary-block">
				<em class="strong">An experienced frontend web developer with strong skills in HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. I have worked for Accenture from 2007 to present on projects at several leading international companies accross the mobile communication, new media, arts and government sectors</em>
				
				<p><span class="detail">Whilst </span><em class="summary-item">achieving a 1st in Maths and Physics at the University of Birmingham</em><span class="detail">, I began development during these courses on languages such as Fortran and matlab. From here, I moved to development in a LAMP environment working for free on a community web project.</span></p>
				
				<p><span class="detail">With this experience behind me I </span><em class="summary-item">joined Accenture in 2007 and began work for a year at an international new media client on a pan-European web content management consolidation project</em><span class="detail">. Development was in TCL and the usual frontend languages and I </span><em class="summary-item">quickly gained experience of working in an agile development environment</em><span class="detail">. Sprints lasted two weeks and production deployments worked on the same timescale, ensuring that I </span><em class="summary-item">have a full understanding of the importance of production ready code</em><span class="detail"> I also learned how important the relationship between development and test teams is.</span></p>
				
				<p><span class="detail">Following that, I spent </span><em class="summary-item">two years as the lead developer on a world leading mobile communications company delivering a bespoke AJAX based order management system</em><span class="detail">. The application made heavy use of Javascript using a framework called TIBCO GI. The emphasis on this project was on ensuring a good design was prepared early on to ensure downstream dependencies could be planned around. Here I became </span><em class="summary-item">familar with how to manage work to satisy the dependencies on larger, slower, downstream teams</em><span class="detail">.</span></p>

				<p><span class="detail">A few other smaller projects followed as a team lead and a industry analyst. </span><em class="summary-item">I have spent a large amount of time focusing heavily on performance enhancements for websites</em><span class="detail"> during these projects. Using tools such as fiddler, JMeter and firebug, load analysis and reduction was key to ensure that a previously very heavy loading web apps became much more responsive and usable for the average user.</span></p>
				
				<p><span class="detail">Currently within Accenture, I have moved on to another long term project. Working as the </span><em class="summary-item">frontend architect on a very large government project</em><span class="detail"> has provided interesting challenges. Focus here has been very much on accessibility and responsive design. </span><em class="summary-item">I have learned a large amount about the art of responsive design and CSS3 functionality from working with Andy Clarke</em><span class="detail">, who was hired given the nature of the project and it's target audience. Additionally, </span><em class="summary-item">I have gained a full understanding of accessibility concerns within a website and those offered by the latest HTML5 features</em><span class="detail"> as these is a key requirement given the typical user of the site</em><span class="detail"> - much emphasis was placed on ensuring heavy, enterprise applications were cleaned and stramlined to make sure that the mark-up remains simple and using the best features of HTML5.</span></p>
